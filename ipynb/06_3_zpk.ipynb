    "# Gains, poles and zeros\n",
    "We are going to look at systems *a lot*, so we need a nice common set of *things* to fully characterise any LTI system. These three magical properties are:\n",
    "- The gain / steady state gain / DC gain: defined as the value of $G(0)$,\n",
    "- The poles: the set of $s$-values for which $G(s)$ is not defined, i.e. when $(sI -A)$ is not invertible or a division by 0 happens in the transfer function,\n",
    "- The zeros: the set of $s$-values for which $G(s) = 0$. (zeros are underrated and you'll see why later)"

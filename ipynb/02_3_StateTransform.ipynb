    "# Coordinate transform\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we want to change the coordinate base of our states, either to give them physical meaning or to cast $A$ into a simpler form. This is rather easy linear algebra, lets say the new state $z=Tx \\rightarrow x = T^{-1}z$. Then we can substitute that into the state space representation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\dot x = Ax + Bu \\rightarrow T^{-1}\\dot z = AT^{-1}z + Bu \\rightarrow \\dot z = \\underbrace{TAT^{-1}}_{\\tilde A} z + \\underbrace{TB}_{\\tilde B}u = \\tilde A z + \\tilde B u.$$\n",
    "and\n",
    "$$ y = Cx + Du \\rightarrow y = \\underbrace{CT^{-1}}_{\\tilde C}z + Du = \\tilde C z + Du.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important: note that the input/output behaviour remains unchanged under state transformations. This is only a system-internal operation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For systems with unique eigenvalues, the system is called diagonalisable, because taking the inverse transformation, $T^{-1}$, to be the horizontally stacked eigenvectors of $A$ results in a diagonal $\\tilde A$. Sometimes stuff is named nice and descriptive."

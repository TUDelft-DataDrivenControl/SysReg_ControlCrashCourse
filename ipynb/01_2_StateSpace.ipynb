    "Cool we know systems now, but it's a bit of an ugly system representation to be honest. Luckily we live in a universe where the state space representation exists and we can recast any system as a vector first order ODE and an output equation. This representation is of the form\n",
    "$$ \\dot x = f(x, u)$$\n",
    "$$ y = h(x, u),$$\n",
    "where $x$ is the state of the system, $u$ the input, and $y$ the output. The state dynamics are described with $f: \\mathbb{R}^n\\times\\mathbb{R}^p\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^n$ and the output measurements with $h: \\mathbb{R}^n\\times\\mathbb{R}^p\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^q$.\n",
    "\n",
    "What black magic do we perform to get these first order ODEs? Well, suppose you have a second order ODE in $v$, $\\ddot v = \\dot v + v$, then this is equivalent to the first order ODE \n",
    "$$ \\begin{bmatrix}\\dot v\\\\\\ddot v\\end{bmatrix}  = \\begin{bmatrix}\\dot v\\\\ \\dot v + v\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}0&1\\\\1&1\\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}\\dot v\\\\ v\\end{bmatrix}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Last but not least of the amazing aspects of the state space representation: there are many nice numerical integrators to simulate them. Think forward Euler or Runge-Kutta."

    "## Transform of arbitrary signals\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a time-varying signal $u(t)$, then there exists its Laplace or Fourier transform $U(s)$, where $s = \\sigma + i\\omega$ for the Laplace transform and $s = i\\omega$ for the Fourier transform.\n",
    "\n",
    "These transforms are defined as\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\}(s) = U(s) = \\int_{0}^\\infty u(t) e^{-st} \\text{d}t,\\; s \\in \\mathbb{C}$$\n",
    "and\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{F}\\{u(t)\\}(\\omega) = U(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty u(t) e^{-i\\omega t} \\text{d}t,\\; \\omega \\in \\mathbb{R}.$$\n",
    "And now you know why it's called the frequency domain: $\\mathfrak{Re}(e^{-st})$ is a (dampened) oscillation! To be completely honest, this is *way* too big of a subject for me to explain. However, I don't have to because of legends like 3Blue1Brown, go watch these if you want to know more:\n",
    "- [watch this video on what Fourier transforms are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6sGWTCMz2k)\n",
    "- [and this one on Laplace transforms.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FE-hM1kRK4Y)\n",

    "\n",
    "But if you don't care about all that and just want to apply it, you need these key fact for the next derivation:\n",
    "- The Fourier transform is very related to the Laplace transform and most things work for both so I'll just continue with the Laplace transform for now,\n",
    "- These transforms basically say that **any** time signal is a sum of (dampened) sinusoids,\n",
    "- Both transforms are linear.\n",
    "- Derivatives and integrations are also linear operators.\n",
    "- The order in which you apply linear operators doesn't matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, some interesting mathematical fact: starting with the definition again\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\}(s) = U(s) = \\int_{0}^\\infty u(t) e^{-st} \\text{d}t,\\; s \\in \\mathbb{C}$$\n",

    "$$ \\qquad\\qquad = -\\frac{u(0) e^{0}}{-s} + \\frac{1}{s} \\mathcal{L}\\left\\{\\frac{\\text{d} u(t)}{\\text{d}t}\\right\\}(s) $$\n",
    "$$ \\qquad\\qquad = \\frac{1}{s}u(0) + \\frac{1}{s} \\mathcal{L}\\left\\{\\frac{\\text{d} u(t)}{\\text{d}t}\\right\\}(s) $$\n",
    "$$ \\implies U(s) = \\frac{1}{s} \\frac{\\text{d} }{\\text{d}t}U(s) + \\frac{1}{s}u(0) $$\n",
    "$$ \\implies sU(s) = \\frac{\\text{d} }{\\text{d}t}U(s) + u(0) $$\n",
    "... Amazing right! No but really this shows two major properties of the Laplace transform:\n",
    "$$ sU(s) = \\frac{\\text{d} }{\\text{d}t}U(s) + u(0) \\implies \\frac{\\text{d}}{\\text{d}t} U(s) = s U(s) - u(0),$$\n",
    "giving us the first amazing result about time derivatives. If we integrate both sides in time, we get the second amazing result about time integration\n",
    "$$ \\int sU(s) \\text{d}t = \\int \\frac{\\text{d} }{\\text{d}t}U(s) + u(0) \\text{d}t \\implies \\int sU(s) \\text{d}t = U(s) + u(0)t \\implies \\int U(s) \\text{d}t = \\frac1s U(s) + \\frac1s u(0)t .$$\n",
    "Then doing a pro engineering move: unless otherwise specified we'll neglect the terms $u(0)$ and $u(0)t$. We are then left with\n",

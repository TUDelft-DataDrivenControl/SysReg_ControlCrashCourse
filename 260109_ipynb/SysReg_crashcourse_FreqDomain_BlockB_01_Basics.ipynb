    " Okay now stuff actually gets a little tricky so I'll have to be a bit more serious sadly.\n",

    " ## The Laplace (and Fourier) Transform is a godsent\n",
    "\n",
    " ### Transform of arbitrary signals\n",
    "\n",
    " Suppose you have a time-varying signal $u(t)$, then there exists its (bilateral) Laplace or Fourier transform $U(s)$, where $s = \\sigma + i\\omega$ for the Laplace transform and $s = i\\omega$ for the Fourier transform.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " These transforms are defined as\n",
    "\n",
    " $$\\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\}(s) = U(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty u(t) e^{-st} \\text{d}t,\\; s \\in \\mathbb{C}$$\n",
    "\n",
    " and\n",
    "\n",
    " $$\\mathcal{F}\\{u(t)\\}(\\omega) = U(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty u(t) e^{-i\\omega t} \\text{d}t,\\; \\omega \\in \\mathbb{R}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    " And now you know why it's called the frequency domain: $\\mathfrak{Re}(e^{-st})$ is a (dampened) oscillation! To be completely honest, this is *way* too big of a subject for me to explain. However, I don't have to because of legends like 3Blue1Brown, go watch these if you want to know more:\n",
    "\n",
    " - [watch this video on what Fourier transforms are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6sGWTCMz2k)\n",
    "\n",
    " - [and this one on Laplace transforms.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FE-hM1kRK4Y)\n",
    "\n",
    " - [Just watch his playlist on differential equations really, the man's a treasure.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNPOjrT6KVlfJuKtYTftqH6)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " But if you don't care about all that and just want to apply it, you need these key fact:\n",
    "\n",
    " - The Fourier transform is a restricted Laplace transform, but most things work for both so I'll just continue with the Laplace transform for now,\n",
    "\n",
    " - These transforms basically say that **any** time signal is a sum of (dampened) sinusoids,\n",
    "\n",
    " - Both transforms are linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " Furthermore, some interesting mathematical fact: starting with the definition again\n",
    "\n",
    " $$\\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\}(s) = U(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty u(t) e^{-st} \\text{d}t,\\; s \\in \\mathbb{C}$$\n",
    "\n",
    " and integrating by part [(trust me bro)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_by_parts)\n",
    "\n",
    " $$ \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\}(s) = \\left[\\frac{u(t) e^{-st}}{-s} \\right]_{-\\infty}^\\infty + \\frac{1}{s} \\mathcal{L}\\left\\{\\frac{\\text{d} u(t)}{\\text{d}t}\\right\\}(s) $$\n",
    "\n",
    " $$ \\qquad\\qquad = \\left[-\\frac{u(-\\infty) e^{s\\infty}}{-s} \\right] + \\frac{1}{s} \\mathcal{L}\\left\\{\\frac{\\text{d} u(t)}{\\text{d}t}\\right\\}(s) $$\n",
    "\n",
    " Now **assuming** $u(-\\infty) = 0$, which really is not that bad of an assumption,\n",
    "\n",
    " $$ \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\}(s) = \\frac{1}{s} \\mathcal{L}\\left\\{\\frac{\\text{d} u(t)}{\\text{d}t}\\right\\}(s).$$\n",
    "\n",
    " ... Amazing right! No but really this shows two major properties of the Laplace and Fourier transforms:\n",
    "\n",
    " $$ \\mathcal{L}\\left\\{\\frac{\\text{d} u(t)}{\\text{d}t}\\right\\}(s) = s \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\}(s) \\Rightarrow \\frac{\\text{d}}{\\text{d}t} U(s) = s U(s)\\text{, and}$$\n",
    "\n",
    " $$ \\mathcal{L}\\left\\{\\int u(t)\\text{d}t\\right\\}(s) = \\frac{1}{s} \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\}(s) \\Rightarrow \\int U(s) \\text{d}t = \\frac{1}{s} U(s).$$\n",
    "\n",
    " ### Transfer functions\n",
    "\n",
    " Now *why* is that so amazing? Lets go back to the basics: the state space in time domain.\n",
    "\n",
    " $$ \\dot x = Ax + Bu, $$\n",
    "\n",
    " $$ y = Cx + Du.$$\n",
    "\n",
    " Now taking that sweet Laplace transform:\n",
    "\n",
    " $$ s X(s) = AX(s) + BU(s), $$\n",
    "\n",
    " $$ Y(s) = CX(s) + DU(s).$$\n",
    "\n",
    " This allows us to look at something interesting: the ratio between the output and the input, called the *transfer function* $\\frac{Y(s)}{U(s)} = G_{yu}(s)$. Pretty straightforward to derive:\n",
    "\n",
    " $$\\rightarrow (sI -A) X(s) = BU(s) \\rightarrow X(s) = (sI -A)^{-1} BU(s) $$\n",
    "\n",
    " $$ Y(s) = CX(s) + DU(s) \\rightarrow Y(s) = C(sI -A)^{-1} BU(s) + DU(s) \\rightarrow Y(s) = (C(sI -A)^{-1} B + D)U(s)$$\n",
    "\n",
    " $$ \\Rightarrow \\frac{Y(s)}{U(s)} = G_{yu}(s) = C(sI -A)^{-1} B + D$$\n",
    "\n",
    " This, however, is only for the steady state, if you also want the transient, it's in the slides.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " For ODEs it's very similar, for example a 2nd order system (mass-spring-dampner systems are the textbook example):\n",
    "\n",
    " $$ m\\ddot x + b\\dot x + k x = \\dot u - q u \\overset{\\mathcal{L}}{\\rightarrow} (ms^2 + bs + k)X(s) = (s - q) U(s).$$\n",
    "\n",
    " $$ \\rightarrow \\frac{X(s)}{U(s)} = G_{xu}(s) = \\frac{s - q}{ms^2 + bs + k}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " ### Gains, poles and zeros\n",
    "\n",
    " So a system can be fully defined by these three magical properties, which are:\n",
    "\n",
    " - The gain / steady state gain / DC gain: defined as the value of $G_{yu}(0)$,\n",
    "\n",
    " - The poles: the set of $s$-values for which $G_{yu}(s)$ is not defined, i.e. when $(sI -A)$ is not invertible or a division by 0 happens in the transfer function,\n",
    "\n",
    " - The zeros: the set of $s$-values for which $G_{yu}(s) = 0$. (zeros are underrated)\n",
    "\n",
    " ### Transfer functions for controls\n",
    "\n",
    " Lets look at a very general control scheme:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " ![General feedback loop](figures/CLsys_general.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " with the block and signals:\n",
    "\n",
    " - $F$ : feedforward controller\n",
    "\n",
    " - $C$ : feedback controller\n",
    "\n",
    " - $P$ : the plant\n",
    "\n",
    " - $r$ : reference signal, global input\n",
    "\n",
    " - $e$ : tracking error\n",
    "\n",
    " - $u$ : control signal\n",
    "\n",
    " - $d$ : input disturbance\n",
    "\n",
    " - $v$ : disturbed input\n",
    "\n",
    " - $\\eta$ : plant output\n",
    "\n",
    " - $n$ : output disturbance\n",
    "\n",
    " - $y$ : disturbed output, global output\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " I'm sure you're now able to do this, but I'll do it for you, the algebraic expressions for the error and output are\n",
    "\n",
    " $$ e = \\frac{F}{1 + PC} r + \\frac{-1}{1 + PC} n + \\frac{-P}{1 + PC} d = G_{er}r + G_{en}n + G_{ed}d \\text{, and}$$\n",
    "\n",
    " $$ y = \\frac{PCF}{1 + PC} r + \\frac{1}{1+PC} n + \\frac{P}{1 + PC} d  = G_{yr}r + G_{yn}n + G_{yd}d.$$\n",
    "\n",
    " You might recognise the fractions as transfer functions and this reveals the robust control problem they might tackle in the master course: how to reject noise, but follow the reference?\n",
